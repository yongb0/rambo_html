			<td>Um,okay. First, when you <em class="t_color">get on</em> a train, you have to let people who are <em class="t_color">getting off</em> a train go first. Second, you have to hold your luggage somewhere in front of you.</td>

			<td>Yeah, I've seen people <em class="t_color">putting their bags on</em> their laps in the video. The train looked so <em>cramped</em> though. Especially the crowds
during rush hour seemed insane.</td>

			<th>Ken</th>
			<td>so true, women sometimes get molested in a crowded train. Poor thing. Anyway, back to the story, you should also <em class="t_color">give up</em> your seat for <em>elders</em>. And set your cell phone to silent mode, and <em>refrain</em> from talking on a train.</td>
