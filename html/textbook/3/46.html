	<p><em>Third Conditional ( If S had Vpp, S would have Vpp)</em></p>
	<p>
		The if-clause states an action that did not take place in the past. However, if the
		action in the if-clause had actually taken place, it is quite probable that the action
		in the result clause would have taken place too. We use the third conditional to talk
		about what might have happened.
