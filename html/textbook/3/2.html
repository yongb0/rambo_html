	<h3><em>Native's Mind</em></h3>
	<p>Have you taken a shower yet? VS. Have you already taken a shower?<br>
	Both “Have you taken a shower yet?” and “Have you already taken a shower?”are asking if the person has taken a shower or not. But they have slightly different shades of meanings.<br>
	“Have you taken a shower yet?” is used when you are simply asking if the person has taken a shower.<br>
	"Have you already taken a shower?" is used when you may actually be surprised if the person has taken a shower, which means you are not really expecting that the person has taken a shower.</p>
