				Hmm, I thought you had already finished your part of the project. <br>
				Designing buildings is the <em>architects'</em> job, isn't it?

				Well, <em>technically</em> yes. But my boss told me not only to design the
				building but also to give a presentation to the clients.

			<th>Emily</th>
			<td>
				That's a lot of <em>expectation</em> there, in a good way of course.
				Are you at least done for today?

			<td>Nah, I wish. I'm waiting for my assistant to bring me my company ID so that I can go back to the office and get some documents.</td>

				Uh-oh. What did your assistant do this time?
