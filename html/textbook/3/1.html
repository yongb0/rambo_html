<p>Present Perfect is often used to talk about actions which happened at unspecified times before now. The exact time is <em>not</em> important. You <em>cannot</em> use Present Perfect with specific time expressions such as: yesterday, one year ago, last week, when I was a child, when I lived in Hawaii, at that moment, that day, etc. But, you <em>can</em> use Present
Perfect with unspecific expressions such as: ever, never, once, many times, several times, before, already, yet, etc.<br>
Today, we will learn one of the most common topics of present perfect, which is <em>Experience.</em>
We often use present perfect to talk about personal experiences, just like the phrases above.</p>
